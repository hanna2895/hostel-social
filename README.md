# Welcome to HostelSocial

Have you ever wanted to meet up with other travelers, but no one was around? Take the stress out of finding a buddy to explore with by using HostelSocial.

This app will let you see who else is in your room, and make plans with other people staying in your hostel. See who else is going to hostel-sponsored events like tours, pub crawls, dinners, or create your own event and invite others to tag along.

Log in using your phone number or using Facebook to easily share contact information with people you met during your stay (if both people agree)

This is a progressive web app (PWA), so once you've added it to your home screen on your phone, it will work with little to no wifi.

This app is built with React / Redux and deployed on Firebase.
